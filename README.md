## Mapshell

The 'mapshell.py' script contans utility functions to trigger file ingest for
behavior and ephys ingest, a facility to launch a basic python environment with
the various schema modules loaded, and a utlity to generate ERD diagrams from
the current code.

## Installation and Setup

Regular users who will be using the code for querying/analysis should
checkout the source code from git and install the package using pythons's `pip`
command. For example:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mesoscale-activity-map/map-ephys.git
    $ cd map-ephys
    $ pip install -e .

This will make the MAP pipeline modules available to your python interpreter as
'pipeline'. A convenience script, `mapshell.py` is available for basic queries
and use of administrative tasks. Account setup, test & usage synopsys using the
shell is as follows:

    $ mapshell.py shell
    Connecting chris@localhost:3306
    Please enter DataJoint username: chris
    Please enter DataJoint password: 
    map shell.

    schema modules:

    - ephys
    - lab
    - experiment
    - ccf
    - publication

    >>> lab.Person()
    *username    fullname
    +----------+ +----------+
    daveliu      Dave Liu
    (1 tuples)

    >>> dj.config.save_local()
    >>> sys.exit()
    $ mapshell.py 
    Connecting user@server:3306
    usage: mapshell.py [populateB|populateE|publish|shell|erd]

Direct installation without a source checkout may be desired for non-interactive
machines - this can be done directly via pip:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/mesoscale-activity-map/map-ephys/

## Test configuration

For testing the schema, the dj_local_conf.json should have the following
configuration variables to modify data without affecting others' databases

  * ingest.behavior.database set to "[username]_ingestBehavior"
  * ingest.ephys.database set to "[username]_ingestEphys"
  * ccf.database set to "[username]_ccf"
  * ephys.database set to "[username]_ephys"
  * experiment.database set to "[username]_experiment"
  * lab.database set to "[username]_lab"
  * publication.database set to "[username]_publication"
  
For accessing the map database, replace [username] with 'map'. Please note all
users can write and Delete the databases.

ingestBehavior.py and ingestEphys.py require the rig_data_path and the username
to be specified in the code (see below).

See the notebooks, Overview.ipynb, for examples

## Ingest Path Expectations

### Behavior Files

The behavior ingest logic searches the rig_data_paths for behavior files.  The
rig data paths are specified in specified dj_local_conf.json as:

    "rig_data_paths": [
        ["RRig", "/Users/chris/src/djc/map/map-sharing/unittest/behavior", "0"]
    ]

if this variable is not configured, hardcoded values in the code matching the
experimental setup will be used.

File paths conform to the pattern:

    dl7/TW_autoTrain/Session Data/dl7_TW_autoTrain_20180104_132813.mat

which is, more generally:

    {h2o}/*/Session Data/{h2o}_{training protocol}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.mat
 
### Ephys Files

The ephys ingest logic searches the ephys_data_paths for processed ephys
data files. These are specified in dj.config.json as:

    "ephys_data_paths": [["/Users/chris/src/djc/map/map-sharing/unittest/ephys", "0"]]

if this variable is not configured, hardcoded values in the code matching
the experimental setup will be used.

File paths conform to the pattern:

    \2017-10-21\tw5ap_imec3_opt3_jrc.mat

which is, more generally:

    \{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}\{h2o}_ap_imec3_opt3_jrc.mat

Older files matched the pattern:

    {h2o}_g0_t0.imec.ap_imec3_opt3_jrc.mat
    {h2o}_g0_t0.imec.ap_imec3_opt3_jrc.mat

### Raw Recording File Publication/Retrieval

The map-ephys pipeline does *not* directly handle processing of raw reording
files into the second-stage processed data used in later stages, however, some
facility is provided for tracking raw data files and transferring them to/from
the ANL 'petrel' faclity[1] using the `globus toolkit` and python SDK[2,3].

#### Configuration

To use this facility, a 'globus endpoint' should be configured and the
following variables set in 'dj_local_conf.json' to match the configuration:

    "globus.local_endpoint": "<uuid value>",
    "globus.local_endpoint_subdir": "<path to storage inside globus>",
    "globus.local_endpoint_local_path": "<path to storage on local filesystem>",

The local endpoint UUID value can be obtained from the 'manage endpoints' screen
within the globus web interface. The 'endpoint_subdir' should be set to the
desired transfer location within the endpoint (as shown in the 'location' bar
within the globus web interface 'transfer files' screen), and the
'endpoint_local_path' should contain the 'real' filesystem location
corresponding to this location. For example, one might have the following
configuration on a mac or linux machine:

    "globus.local_endpoint": "C40E971D-0075-4A82-B12F-8F9717762E7B",
    "globus.local_endpoint_subdir": "map/raw",
    "globus.local_endpoint_local_path": "/globus/map/raw"

Or perhaps something like the following on a Windows machine:

    "globus.local_endpoint": "C40E971D-0075-4A82-B12F-8F9717762E7B",
    "globus.local_endpoint_subdir": "map/raw",
    "globus.local_endpoint_local_path": "C:\globus\map\raw",

please note that the 'local_endpoint_subdir' should use the globus convention of
using forward slashes ('/') for directory separation, whereas the
'local_endpont_local_path' should use whatever convention is used by the host
operating system running the map-ephys code.

#### Login to Globus

Before the globus interface can be used, an application token must be generated.
This can be done from within the 'mapshell.py' shell as follows:

    $ ./scripts/mapshell.py shell
    Connecting chris@localhost:3306
    map shell.
    
    schema modules:
    
      - ephys
      - lab
      - experiment
      - ccf
      - publication
      - ingest.behavior
      - ingest.ephys
    
    >>> publication.GlobusStorageManager()
    Please login via: https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/authorize?client_id=C40E971D-0075-4A82-B12F-8F9717762E7B&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.globus.org%2Fv2%2Fweb%2Fauth-code&scope=openid+profile+email+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Atransfer.api.globus.org%3Aall&state=_default&response_type=code&code_challenge=cb9c10826b86ff9851cf477cad554e8d01c03a2b416b0210783c544deea1f372&code_challenge_method=S256&access_type=offline
    and enter code:f881e45fc2c52929b3924863c87f88
    INFO:datajoint.settings:Setting globus.token to c00264046ac1d484ec8db2b8acfa1f21ef0c68939d0ce2d562b21eb400eefd7802676efe1ddcc665141ef56f44699
    <pipeline.globus.GlobusStorageManager object at 0x10f874780>
    >>> dj.config.save('dj_local_conf.json')

As can be seen from the above, calling 'publication.GlobusStorageManager()' from
the mapshell interpreter will prompt the user to login in a web browser, and
paste an authrization code back to the script, which then completes the process
of requesting an access token. From there, the configuration is saved via the
'dj.config.save' function.

This process only needs to be performed once to generate a valid
dj_local_conf.json file suitable for future sessions. Please note that after
login, the dj_local_conf.json file will contain a security sensitive access
token which should not be shared with anyone who should not have access to your
globus account.

#### Usage (Data Publisher)

Once the local globus endpoint has been configured, population and data transfer
of the raw data files can be performed using the 'mapshell.py' utility function
'publish', which simply wraps a call to 'ArchivedRawEphysTrial.populate()'.

The population logic will look for files underneath the local storage path
matching project naming conventions for the ingested experimental sessions, and
if corresponding files are found, transfer them to petrel and log an available
entry in the publication schema. These records can then be used by users to
query and retrieve the raw data files (see below).

#### Usage (Data Consumer)

Once the local globus endpoint has been configured, retrieval of raw data
files can be done interactively using DataJoint operations in combination
with the '.retrieve()' method of the ArchivedRawEphysTrial class.

For example, to fetch all raw recordings related to subject #407513,
the following DataJoint expression can be used:

    >>> (publication.ArchivedRawEphysTrial() & {'subject_id': 407513}).retrieve()

This will save the related files to the configured local globus storage path.
In the event of issues, be sure to check that the endpoint is configured as
writable. Also, to note, care should be taken not to retrieve files on the same
computer used to transmit them, lest the original files be overwritten;
Disabling the writable setting on machines used for data publication should 
help prevent this issue from occurring.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests for ingest are present in the 'tests' directory and can be run using
the 'nostests' command. These tests will *destructively* delete the actively
configured databases and perform data ingest and transfer tasks using the data
stored within the 'test_data' directory.
